first of all we need to check that the /user/acadgild/hadoop directory exists in the HDFS root
directory :
so we will use the following comand:

> hadoop fs -ls /user/acadgild/hadoop/

where  fs  --> is used to run generic file system user client.
      -ls /user/acadgild/hadoop/ --> this will list the directory with absolute path that is user/acadgild/hadoop in this case.
      
      
on executing this command we got -
output ---> No such file or directory

that means that /user/acadgild/hadoop directory doesn't exist.
