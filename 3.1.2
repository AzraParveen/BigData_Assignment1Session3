As,we found that directory  /user/acadgild/hadoop doesn't exist so we need to create that :

with the following command we can create directory named : /user/acadgild/hadoop -
 >hadoop fs -mkdir /user/acadgild/hadoop/
 
 
 this command will create our directory
 
 now ,we need to check that directory is created or not than we will check using
 > hadoop fs -ls
 this will show that we made hadoop directory sucessfully.
 
 
 Now we need to create a subdirectory let say azra ,so using following command we can do that.
 
 >  hadoop fs -mkdir /user/acadgild/hadoop/azra/
 
 using >  hadoop fs -ls /user/acadgild/hadoop/ we can check that azra sub directory is there.
